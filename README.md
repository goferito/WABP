# WABP
Boilerplate for Express 4 Web Apps. Includes a very basic auth,
Mongo connection, and some examples of models, controllers, views,
layout based on bootstrap, and more stuff that I'll write here when
not in a fucking rush.

### Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Create the secrets.js from the example
3. Remove the .git folder, and init a new repository for the new project
4. Change the package.json repository info
5. npm i
6. Change everything else

### TODO
* Make a proper working example with the pizzas and the requests
* Add support for tests
* Do the TODOs in the code
